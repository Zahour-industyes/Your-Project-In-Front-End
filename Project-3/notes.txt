To make element that is big as a side without scroll (for example when I need a image on a background of a main title of web) we will
set width to 100% and height to 100vh.

pages dont have the same width it changes with the elements and other things on the web



Centering code :
display: block;
margin-left: auto;
margin-right: auto;
